# MCP Grafana Data Source Plugin - Project Plan

## Overview
This project aims to create a Grafana data source plugin that connects to Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers and enables natural language querying of data sources through MCP tools and resources.

## Project Goals
- Build a backend plugin that can connect to any MCP server
- Enable natural language queries that get translated to appropriate MCP tool calls
- Provide a seamless integration between Grafana dashboards and MCP-enabled data sources
- Support both query data and resource capabilities for maximum flexibility

## Technical Architecture

### Backend Components (Go)
1. **MCP Client Integration**
   - WebSocket/HTTP client for MCP server communication
   - MCP protocol implementation (JSON-RPC 2.0 over transport)
   - Connection management and health monitoring

2. **Query Processing Engine**
   - Natural language query parser
   - Query-to-MCP-tool mapping logic
   - Response transformation to Grafana data frames

3. **Plugin Capabilities Implementation**
   - Query Data: Handle dashboard and alert queries
   - Resources: Custom endpoints for MCP server discovery and tool listing
   - Health Checks: MCP server connectivity validation

### Frontend Components (TypeScript/React)
1. **Configuration Editor**
   - MCP server connection settings (URL, authentication)
   - Tool discovery and selection interface
   - Connection testing functionality

2. **Query Editor** 
   - Natural language query input
   - MCP tool selection dropdown
   - Query preview and validation
   - Example queries and documentation

## Key Features

### Core Functionality
- **MCP Server Connection**: Support for HTTP and WebSocket MCP transports
- **Natural Language Queries**: Accept plain English queries from users
- **Dynamic Tool Discovery**: Automatically discover available MCP tools
- **Data Frame Conversion**: Transform MCP responses to Grafana-compatible format
- **Multi-server Support**: Connect to multiple MCP servers simultaneously

### Advanced Features
- **Query Caching**: Cache MCP responses for performance
- **Streaming Support**: Real-time data updates from MCP streams
- **Authentication**: Support various MCP authentication methods
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error reporting and recovery
- **Metrics Collection**: Plugin performance and usage metrics

## MCP Integration Details

### Supported MCP Capabilities
- **Tools**: Call MCP tools with natural language intent mapping
- **Resources**: Access MCP resources for configuration and metadata
- **Prompts**: Use MCP prompts for query suggestion and completion

### Query Flow
1. User enters natural language query in Grafana
2. Plugin analyzes query intent and context
3. Map query to appropriate MCP tool(s)
4. Execute MCP tool calls with derived parameters
5. Transform response data to Grafana data frames
6. Return structured data for visualization

## Technical Considerations

### Performance
- Connection pooling for MCP servers
- Response caching strategy
- Efficient data frame transformation
- Async query processing

### Security
- Secure credential storage for MCP servers
- Input sanitization for natural language queries
- Rate limiting and request validation

### Scalability
- Support for multiple concurrent MCP connections
- Horizontal scaling considerations
- Resource management and cleanup

## Development Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation (Backend Core)
- Basic MCP client implementation
- Plugin skeleton with health checks
- Simple query-to-tool translation

### Phase 2: Frontend Integration
- Configuration editor for MCP servers
- Basic query editor interface
- Connection testing and validation

### Phase 3: Advanced Querying
- Natural language processing improvements
- Multiple tool orchestration
- Complex data transformation

### Phase 4: Production Features
- Performance optimization
- Comprehensive error handling
- Documentation and examples

### Phase 5: Advanced Features
- Streaming data support
- Advanced authentication
- Metrics and monitoring

## Success Criteria
- Successfully connect to popular MCP servers
- Execute natural language queries with 90%+ accuracy
- Provide sub-second response times for cached queries
- Support at least 10 concurrent MCP connections
- Comprehensive test coverage (>80%)
- Production-ready documentation and examples

## Risk Mitigation
- **MCP Protocol Changes**: Pin to stable MCP specification versions
- **Performance Issues**: Implement comprehensive caching and optimization
- **Security Concerns**: Follow Grafana security best practices
- **Compatibility**: Test with multiple MCP server implementations
